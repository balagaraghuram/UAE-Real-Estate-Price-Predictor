1. **Data Cleaning** via `--clean`  
2. **Model Training** (both **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**) via `--train`  
3. **Price Predictions** through a command-line interface via `--predict`

Users can run **one** or **all** steps with **simple flags**, ensuring a consistent and streamlined workflow.
